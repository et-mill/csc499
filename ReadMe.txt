Elliot Miller - CSC 499 - Homework 1: Sort Names
################################################

A simple script to sort a list of names, first by their length, and then alphabetically.
The script outputs the results to a user determined text file.

To run the program, open a terminal in the file location of the sort_names.py script,
call the script with arguments 'input file path', 'output file path'.

Example terminal command:
>python sort_names.py 'Sort Me.txt' 'Sorted Names.txt'


Let me know if you have any questions, thanks for your time!
Tested on Manjaro Linux, not sure if there's any particularities with OSX file paths.
